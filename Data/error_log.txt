  Problem(s) found when testing validity of SortedByQueryHits object returned by subsetting operation: 'queryHits(x)'

In addition: Warning messages:
1: In GenomicRanges:::valid.GenomicRanges.seqinfo(x) :
  GAlignments object contains 1024 out-of-bound ranges located on sequence chr20. Note that only ranges located on a
  non-circular sequence whose length is not NA can be considered out-of-bound (use seqlengths() and isCircular() to get
  the lengths and circularity flags of the underlying sequences).
2: In valid.GenomicRanges.seqinfo(x, suggest.trim = TRUE) :
  GRanges object contains 1024 out-of-bound ranges located on sequence chr20. Note that only ranges located on a
  non-circular sequence whose length is not NA can be considered out-of-bound (use seqlengths() and isCircular() to get
  the lengths and circularity flags of the underlying sequences). You can use trim() to trim these ranges. See
  ?`trim,GenomicRanges-method` for more information.
